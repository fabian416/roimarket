## Roi Market

## Overview

This is a virtual supermarket game project developed in Unity. The game aims to simulate a real-life shopping experience, where players can pick up a cart, shop for products, and check out. The game uses low-poly, Roblox-style graphics to provide a friendly experience.

Please note that the actual 3D assets used in this game are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. They are available for purchase in the Unity Asset Store. The links to these assets are:

- [Character Asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/low-poly-characters-pack-111860)

This repository mainly contains the scripts I wrote for the game, which handle player movement, interactions with the environment, the checkout process, as well as the integration with Amazon Cognito for user sign-in, and Amazon RDS for the database.

## Future plans
This prototype is still under development. I will continue working on it in my free time to improve its features and functionality, such as smoother movement and a more optimal graphical interface for reviewing products in the cart.
